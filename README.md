# stack_java

##  Introduction 
This is my own Stack class that is written by me by using either Array List or Linked List. The purpose is to learn more about Stack  
##  Version: 
-	It is written by using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2019.1.3 x64
-	JDK version 11
##	How to install:
If you use IntelliJ IDEA use new -> Project From Version Control -> Git and paste https://github.com/JimmyYouhei/stack_java.git
##	How to use: 
-	Using the Main class to run and test any method 
-	Then you can use either the LinkedListStack class or the ArrayListStack: 
    -	peek(): look at the object at the top of the stack 
    -	pop() : remove but not return (intended that way) the object at the top of the stack 
    -	push(Object toBePushed): push an object to the top of the Stack  
    -	print(): print all the element
##	Note:
-	Due to the class is written purely for learning purpose so very little Exception handle is expected
